# To Do App

A simple web app for a todo project. We are creating a new MVP, this new platform must be scalable and flexible to support our continuous growth. We want to implement a micro-service architecture and the first part of the project is to develop a to-do web app with two sets of REST endpoints and the UI to display the data
